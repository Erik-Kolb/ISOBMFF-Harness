# ISOBMFF-Harness


Command Lines and Interesting Notes I have Found regarding fuzzing sessions for ISOBMFF executables with ISOBMFF test files:

 > ../AFL/afl-fuzz -i IN -o OUT -d ./bin/hevc_extractors -i @@ -o /dev/null 
* This uses the test_sampledescription_HEVC.mp4 file in the "IN" Folder

2. > ../AFL/afl-fuzz -i IN -o OUT -d ./bin/MP4_to_DRC -i @@ -o /dev/null
*This command uses the 01_simple.mp4 file in the "IN" folder, but it does not seem to find any crashes *ask for help with line syntax
*Nothing seems to change when I use a different test input generated by ISOBMFF

3. Interesting Note: When I go to fuzz the MP4_to_WAV executable with the test input "test_item.mp4", it causes the program to crash automatically. 

4. > ../AFL/afl-fuzz -i IN -o OUT -d ./bin/MP4_to_WAV -i @@ -o /dev/null 
*This command line was used with "test_meta_entity.mp4" to fuzz "MP4_to_WAV" executable

5. Interesting Note: > ../AFL/afl-fuzz -i IN -o OUT -d ./bin/vvc_demuxer -i @@ when I tried this command line with "test_meta_entity.mp4" as the input, the executbale crashed immediately and would not continue to fuzz
